			<h1>thom_tl's website</h1>
			Hi and welcome to my small corner of the internet. I'm Thomas (Thomas/Thomas), a 15-year-old hobbyist programmer all the way from the land of the dikes. I'm currently majoring in highschool and intend to move to [redacted] in the foreseeable future.

I taught myself C++ when I was about 11 or 12, and gradually from there started to develop an interest in programming. I taught myself Lua and then C#, and to this day, C++ remains the superior programming language in my eyes. I'm also fluent in x86 assembly language and familiar with hardware-level programming of the PC.

My other obsessions interests include history, physics, chemistry. I was once interested in low-level programming and joined an ACPI implementation, but it's still for me.
